\chapter{Change}

\begin{equation}
\text{Change} = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} (C + P(e^{\alpha t}) - D \cdot \ln(|G| + 1))\,dt
\end{equation}

\textbf{Where:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $C$: The constant desire for change within an individual or society.
    \item $P$: The potential for change driven by external pressures or internal motivations.
    \item $e^{\alpha t}$: The exponential growth factor of change over time, where $\alpha$ is the rate of change and $t$ is time.
    \item $D$: The resistance or difficulty to change, encompassing societal norms, personal habits, or legislative barriers.
    \item $\ln(|G| + 1)$: The logarithmic growth of understanding or awareness regarding the need or desire for change, where $G$ represents the cumulative knowledge or insight gained over time.
    \item $t_0$: The initial time period or starting point for observation.
    \item $t_1$: The final time period or end point for observation.
\end{itemize}
