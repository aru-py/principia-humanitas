\chapter{Night}

\begin{equation}
\text{Night} = \frac{C \cdot (P + D) + M \cdot S}{L^2}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Where:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $C$: The degree of cultural impact (e.g., festivals, traditions) occurring during night.
    \item $P$: The level of personal reflection or introspection typical of night.
    \item $D$: The depth of dreams, measured as a combination of their vividness and emotional significance.
    \item $M$: The magnitude of mythological or literary narratives inspired by or set during the night.
    \item $S$: The silence or tranquility of the environment, a quantifiable decrease in ambient noise.
    \item $L$: The luminosity of the night sky, influenced by factors such as moonlight and urban lighting.
