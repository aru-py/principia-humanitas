\chapter{Legacy}

\begin{equation}
\text{Legacy} = \frac{(C \cdot I) + (A \cdot E)}{T} + R
\end{equation}

\textbf{Where:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $C$: Contributions to society (measured in the impact or changes made in your field or community)
    \item $I$: Ideas and innovations (measured by their adoption and the breadth of their influence)
    \item $A$: Personal accomplishments (measured by their recognition and significance)
    \item $E$: Emotional connections (measured by the number of people you've significantly impacted)
    \item $T$: Time (measured in years, as an inverse to suggest that greater legacies can be built in a shorter time with more significant contributions and connections)
    \item $R$: Resilience of memory (measured by the length of time and strength with which your contributions, ideas, and emotional bonds remain influential or remembered after your passing)
\end{itemize}
