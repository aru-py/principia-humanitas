\chapter{Betrayal}

\begin{equation}
\text{Betrayal} = \frac{e^{\eta \cdot (T - I)} \cdot (A + U)^\alpha}{(L + 1)^\beta}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Where:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $e$: The base of natural logarithms, representing the irrationality of emotions involved in betrayal.
    \item $\eta$: The intensity of trust prior to the betrayal.
    \item $T$: The total trust placed in the betrayer before the act.
    \item $I$: The individual's intuition or premonition about potential betrayal.
    \item $A$: The depth of the attachment to the betrayer.
    \item $U$: The level of unexpectedness of the betrayal.
    \item $\alpha$: The personal threshold to forgive, influencing how deeply one feels betrayed.
    \item $L$: The amount of lies told or truths hidden by the betrayer.
    \item $\beta$: A measure of resilience or capacity to bounce back, mitigating the effect of betrayal.
\end{itemize}
