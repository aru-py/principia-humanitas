\chapter{Separation}

\begin{equation}
\text{Separation} = \sqrt{\frac{(P - C)^2 + L^2}{T + 1}} - \int_{0}^{A} E(s) ds + U
\end{equation}

\textbf{Where:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $P$: Physical distance between individuals.
    \item $C$: Emotional closeness, which offsets physical distance.
    \item $L$: Level of commitment or legal ties.
    \item $T$: Time since last interaction.
    \item $A$: Age of the relationship.
    \item $E(s)$: Events over time that have influenced the separation, where $s$ represents specific moments.
    \item $U$: Underlying factors or unpredictable elements affecting separation.
\end{itemize}
