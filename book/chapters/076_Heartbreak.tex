\chapter{Heartbreak}

\begin{equation}
\text{Heartbreak} = \frac{L \cdot (1-e^{-xT})}{C} + P \cdot \ln{(1 + |E|)} - D\cdot \sin{(t)}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Where:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $L$: Depth of love
    \item $e$: Base of the natural logarithm, representing the continuous and irrational aspects of healing
    \item $x$: Time factor of healing process
    \item $T$: Time since the heartbreak occurred
    \item $C$: Personal resilience or capacity to cope
    \item $P$: Presence of a support system
    \item $E$: External factors complicating recovery (financial issues, life pressures, etc.)
    \item $D$: Depth of disillusionment or betrayal felt
    \item $t$: Current time, representing the cyclic nature of emotional pain and recovery
\end{itemize}
