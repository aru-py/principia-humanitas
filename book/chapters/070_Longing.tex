\chapter{Longing}

\begin{equation}
\text{Longing} = \frac{M \times (H + D)^\alpha}{(R + 1)^\beta} + \int_{0}^{T} \gamma e^{-\lambda t} dt
\end{equation}

\textbf{Where:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $M$: Magnitude of desire for something unattainable
    \item $H$: Historical attachment or importance of the object of longing
    \item $D$: Distance or difficulty in achieving or attaining the object of longing
    \item $\alpha$: Factor representing the compounding effect of history and difficulty on longing
    \item $R$: Resources or opportunities available to lessen the perceived distance or difficulty
    \item $\beta$: Factor demonstrating the power of resources or opportunities to mitigate longing
    \item $\gamma$: Intensity of initial yearning or desire
    \item $\lambda$: Rate at which longing decreases over time naturally
    \item $t$: Time
    \item $T$: Total time considering or experiencing longing
\end{itemize}
