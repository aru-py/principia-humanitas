\chapter{Recovery}

\begin{equation}
\text{Recovery} = \frac{S \cdot H \cdot F}{P} + \int (E(t) \cdot dt) - D + C
\end{equation}

\textbf{Where:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $S$: The support system available, representing the collective strength derived from friends, family, and community.
    \item $H$: Hope, quantifying the individualâ€™s outlook and expectations for the future.
    \item $F$: Flexibility in thinking and adaptability to change, illustrating the capability to adjust and find solutions in varying circumstances.
    \item $P$: Pain or distress level, as a denominator, it challenges recovery, making it inversely proportional.
    \item $E(t)$: Effort over time, representing the continuous dedication and work towards recovery, integrated over the recovery period.
    \item $D$: Detriments, including setbacks or unexpected challenges that hinder the process.
    \item $C$: Cultural and personal identity, a constant that adds to recovery by grounding an individual in their sense of self and belonging.
\end{itemize}
