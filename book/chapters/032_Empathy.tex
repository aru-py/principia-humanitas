\chapter{Empathy}

\begin{equation}
\text{Empathy} = \int_{0}^{C} \left(\frac{H \cdot E}{P + K} - D\right) \, dC
\end{equation}

\textbf{Where:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $C$: Context of the situation, varying from $0$ to the complexity level of the situation.
    \item $H$: Human connection coefficient, quantifying the inherent ability to connect with others emotionally.
    \item $E$: Exposure to diverse experiences and perspectives, enhancing understanding of others.
    \item $P$: Personal biases and prejudices, which can cloud judgment and empathy.
    \item $K$: Knowledge of the other person or group, with greater knowledge generally facilitating empathy.
    \item $D$: Distraction or noise in the environment or within the individual, which detracts from the ability to empathize.
\end{itemize}
