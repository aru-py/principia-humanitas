\begin{equation}
\text{Regret} = \frac{(P \times D) + \sum_{i=1}^{n} (C_i \times I_i)}{A} - H

    \item $P$: Potential of the opportunity lost or the perceived value of the missed opportunity.
    \item $D$: Depth of desire for the missed outcome, reflecting the emotional intensity tied to the opportunity.
    \item $C_i$: The cost of alternative choices not taken, weighted by the individual's value system.
    \item $I_i$: Importance of each alternative choice not taken, in the grand scheme of the individual's life.
    \item $A$: Awareness or recognition of the regret after the fact, which influences the intensity of the regret.
    \item $H$: Hope or the belief in the possibility of overcoming the consequences of the missed opportunity.
    \item $n$: The number of alternative choices considered by the individual.
