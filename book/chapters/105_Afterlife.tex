\begin{equation}
\text{Afterlife} = \int_{0}^{X} (\mathcal{L}(x) + \mathcal{E}(x) - \mathcal{D})dx + \sqrt{\mathcal{H}^2 + \mathcal{P}^2}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Where:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $X$: Measure of one's life span, from birth to death.
    \item $\mathcal{L}(x)$: Represents the accumulated love over the course of one's life, a function of $x$ (time).
    \item $\mathcal{E}(x)$: Represents the accumulated experiences and knowledge gained, a function of $x$ (time).
    \item $\mathcal{D}$: Represents the constant decay or loss (e.g., missed opportunities, regrets).
    \item $\mathcal{H}$: Represents the humanistic values such as empathy, integrity, and altruism one has adhered to.
