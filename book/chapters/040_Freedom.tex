\[
\text{Freedom} = \frac{(L + E + A)^\alpha}{(O + P)^\beta}
\]

\textbf{Where:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $L$: Level of literacy and education (acknowledging that knowledge frees minds)
    \item $E$: Economic independence (the ability to sustain oneself autonomously)
    \item $A$: Access to unbiased information (a measure of the degree of media freedom and net neutrality)
    \item $O$: Oppression (the degree of authoritarian imposition or constraint on freedoms)
    \item $P$: Poverty (as economic dependency limits freedom of choice and action)
    \item $\alpha$: the power of positive influences on freedom; embodies the synergistic effect of literacy, economic independence, and access to information
    \item $\beta$: the power of negative influences on freedom; captures how oppression and poverty compound to reduce freedom
\end{itemize}
