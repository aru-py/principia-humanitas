\chapter{Creativity}

\begin{equation}
\text{Creativity} = \frac{I \times (E + K + S)^P}{C + D}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Where:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $I$: Inspiration - external stimuli that spark creative thought
    \item $E$: Experience - the sum of all past experiences, knowledge, and skills
    \item $K$: Knowledge - specifically, domain-relevant information
    \item $S$: Skills - the ability to manipulate knowledge and create new ideas or artifacts
    \item $P$: Passion - the intrinsic motivation or drive to engage in and pursue creative activities
    \item $C$: Constraints - limitations that can either hinder or, paradoxically, enhance creativity depending on their nature and the individual's response
    \item $D$: Distraction - external noise or thoughts that detract from focus on creative tasks
\end{itemize}
