\begin{equation}
\text{Wonder} = \frac{C \cdot I^2 \cdot (E + M)}{D}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Where:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $C$: Curiosity about the natural world and human experience.
    \item $I$: Imagination to conceive of what is not immediately present.
    \item $E$: Emotional response to the new and unknown.
    \item $M$: Memory, the accumulation of past experiences that interact with the present.
    \item $D$: Distraction, elements that draw attention away from the object of wonder.
