\chapter{Madness}

\begin{equation}
\text{Madness} = \frac{P(v,t) + D \cdot \rho(e) - C}{A^2} + \ln{(I + 1)}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Where:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $P(v,t)$: Pressure of societal expectations and personal ambitions, as a function of values ($v$) and time ($t$).
    \item $D$: Depth of individual desires or dreams.
    \item $\rho(e)$: Density of external influences, depending on the environment ($e$).
    \item $C$: Level of comprehension or self-awareness.
    \item $A$: Strength of personal anchors or reality checks.
    \item $I$: Intensity of internal conflict.
    \item $\ln{(I+1)}$: Logarithmic scale to manage the influence of internal conflict, ensuring its contribution remains within a realistic scale regardless of its intensity.
\end{itemize}
