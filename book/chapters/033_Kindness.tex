\chapter{Kindness}

\begin{equation}
\text{Kindness} = \frac{{C \times (E + U)^\alpha}}{{(S + I)^{\beta}}}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Where:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $C$: Compassion, an innate or learned propensity to show empathy and concern for others.
    \item $E$: Efforts made towards understanding others, encompassing acts of empathy and listening.
    \item $U$: Unconditional actions, those kindness acts done without expecting anything in return.
    \item $S$: Selfishness, actions or behaviors primarily concerned with personal profit or pleasure.
    \item $I$: Ignorance, the lack of awareness, understanding, or information regarding the feelings or situations of others.
    \item $\alpha$: The scaling factor for positive actions, representing how acts of kindness and understanding scale nonlinearly with effort and unconditional actions.
    \item $\beta$: The scaling factor for negative attributes, representing how selfishness and ignorance dampen the effect of kindness in a nonlinear manner.
\end{itemize}
