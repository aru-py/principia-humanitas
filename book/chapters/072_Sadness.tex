    \item $G$: Guilt (for actions taken or not taken)
    \item $T$: Trauma (past experiences causing emotional pain)
    \item $H$: Hope (for the future, counteracts sadness)
    \item $A$: Affection (received from others, mitigates sadness)
    \item $E$: Empathy (ability to understand and share the feelings of another)
