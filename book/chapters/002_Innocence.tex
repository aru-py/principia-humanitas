\chapter{Innocence}

\begin{equation}
\text{Innocence} = \frac{\textit{A} \cdot \textit{H} + \sqrt{\textit{E}}}{\textit{C} + \exp{(-\textit{T})}} - \frac{\textit{L}}{\textit{G}^2}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Where:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $A$: Age, representing the purity associated with youth.
    \item $H$: Hope, quantifying an individual’s optimistic outlook on life.
    \item $E$: Experience, acknowledging that some lived experiences factor into one’s innocence.
    \item $C$: Cynicism, an inverse measure of trust or belief in the inherent goodness.
    \item $T$: Time, recognizing that innocence evolves over temporal transitions.
    \item $L$: Loss, sum of all losses (physical, emotional, etc.) endured, which subtracts from one’s innocence.
    \item $G$: Growth, representing personal and moral development, squared to acknowledge its profound impact.
\end{itemize}
