\poem{Learning}{Learning = \frac{{P^{c} \cdot I}}{{(1 + F) \cdot (T + 1)}}}{\item $P$: \index{Practice}\textit{Practice}. The dedicated effort towards learning. More practice typically results in better information retention and understanding.
\item $I$: \index{Interest}\textit{Interest}. The enthusiasm for the subject. High interest can fuel curiosity and motivation, thus boosting the learning process.
\item $F$: \index{Fatigue}\textit{Fatigue}. The combined physical and mental exhaustion affecting learning. It can decrease concentration and cognitive performance, impairing the process.
\item $T$: \index{Pressure}\textit{Pressure}. The urgency felt to learn within a deadline. It can increase stress, which negatively impacts effective learning.
\item $c$: \index{Impact Factor}\textit{Impact Factor}. Describes the exponential effect of practice on learning. It highlights that the benefits of practice on learning effectiveness increase non-linearly with more practice.
