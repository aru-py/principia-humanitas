# Quantitative Poems

## Overview

This book is a quantitative exploration of the human experience through equations generated by artificial intelligence. It's still a work in progress, and I need to improve the equation generation algorithm, but wanted to share the proof-of-concept.

ðŸ“šYou can read it [here](https://aru.ai/quantitative-poems).

ðŸ“™ You can buy it on [Amazon](<https://www.amazon.com/Quantitative-Poems-Machines-Perspective-Quantified-ebook/dp/B0CW1BT5HY/>) (Paperback coming soon!).
